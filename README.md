## Overview
 
OpenBOR is a royalty free sprite-based side scrolling gaming engine. From humble beginnings in 2004, it has since grown into the most versatile, easy to use, and powerful engine of its type you will find anywhere. OpenBOR is optimized for side scrolling beat em’ up style games (Double Dragon, Streets of Rage, Final Fight), but easily accommodates any sort of gameplay style and feature set you can imagine.

Want to try your hand at game making? Open one of the already existing modules and tinker around – the community is right here to help you along.

Ready to make something of your own? Get some images together and away you go! 

Feeling ambitious? Delve into the built-in script engine and graphical suite to build a masterpiece rivaling the most outlandish Triple-A productions. Sell it if you if can!

## History

* **2003 -** [Senile Team](http://www.senileteam.com) releases Beats of Rage, a free beat-'em-up for DOS inspired by SEGA's Streets of Rage series using assets from SNK Playmore's King of Fighters series. The game quickly achieves mass popularity through word of mouth. Senile Team releases an edit pack allowing anyone interested to create a module for the BOR engine.

* **2005 -** Developer *Kirby2000* asks Senile Team to open the source code to BOR. They agreed, and the project is named OpenBOR. The project quickly spawns numerous ports and branches, each with unique features.

* **2006 -** Developer *[Sumo1X (SX)](https://github.com/SumolX)* reorganizes the loose coalition of developers into what is now known as the OpenBOR Team. Features from the various branches are backported into the original OpenBOR.

* **2011 -** *[Sumo1X](https://github.com/SumolX)* retires from the OpenBOR Team, and hands management duties to [DCurrent (Damon Caskey)](https://github.com/DCurrent).

* **2017 -** OpenBOR repository migrates from SourceForge to Github.

* **2021 -** Development continues on OpenBOR 4.0, with various internal source cleanups, a more object centric script engine, and fixes for long standing issues.

#### [Plombo](https://github.com/plombo) (2009-)
A developer who prefers to work on OpenBOR's supporting libraries and platform-specific backends.  Known for maintaining the Wii port, writing the GPU-accelerated video code for Wii and OpenGL, and a few engine features.

#### [Malik](https://github.com/msmalik681) (2018-)
Malik came to the team with a strong OpenBOR scripting background, and quickly established himself as a resident go-to for the Android Port. Malik dedicates himself to keeping the Android port of OpenBOR a commercially viable platform for authors who wish to sell their original IP projects.

#### [Douglas Baldan](https://github.com/dbaldan) (2018-2021)
Known as O'Ilusionista, Douglas was a highly respected administrator of the OpenBOR community and a prolific member of the Mugen scene. His professional background in graphic design brought a plethora of graphic and game development experience to the team. Citing personal reasons, Douglas officially retired from the OpenBOR team mid-2021.

#### [Wasin Thonkaew](https://github.com/haxpor) (2019)
Haxpor in the forums, a Linux centric developer who works hard to ensure our penguin crowd has the proper tools for development and underlying libraries of OpenBOR remain compatible to compile for mobile platforms.

#### [crxtrdude](https://github.com/crxtrdude) (2016-2018)
crxtrdude focused on the android port in particular on the module Activity, Manifest and on the virtual gamepad.

#### [uTunnels](https://github.com/utunnels) (2007-2014)
Among many other powerful additions, contributed the original scripting engine to OpenBOR, single handedly
breaking nearly every limitation module authors faced. While not officially retired, uTunnels' presence became gradually more infrequent before stopping altogether in early 2014.

#### Anallyst (2011)
This developer's work centered mainly around trimming the fat and optimizing the codebase.

#### SumolX (2006-2011)
Former project manager and lead programmer, retired from the scene in 2011. Known for porting PSP,
PS3, Linux, Wii, GP2X and maintaining all other platforms and code base.

## Websites
### [ChronoCrash](http://www.ChronoCrash.com)

Home of the OpenBOR community and OpenBOR team. This is the place to go if you want to discuss OpenBOR development, find ready to play game modules, or get started building one of your own. 

### [Senile Team](http://www.senileteam.com)

Senile Team does not support OpenBOR or BOR in any way. Instead, you should stop in to see their latest projects - you’ll no doubt find something interesting!

## New Features
* added "movex", "movez" to entityproperty: the potential entity directions
* added "collidedentity" to script: it returns the collided entity handler
* opened animation platform properties to script

#### ***NEW OPERATORS***
bitwise not (~)<br/>

#### ***NEW FUNCTIONS***
rumble(player_index, ratio, milliseconds)<br/>

#### ***ENTITY COLLISION***
accessible in debug mode too.<br/>

constants:<br/>
ANI_PROP_ENTITY_COLLISION<br/>
ENTITY_COLLISION_PROP_COORDINATES<br/>
ENTITY_COLLISION_PROP_TAG<br/>
ENTITY_COLLISION_PROP_INDEX<br/>

animation commands:<br/>
ebox {x} {y} {width} {height} {z1} {z2}<br/>
ebox.x {value}<br/>
ebox.y {value}<br/>
ebox.width {value}<br/>
ebox.height {value}<br/>
ebox.z1 {value}<br/>
ebox.z2 {value}<br/>
eboxz {z1} {z2}<br/>

model commands:<br/>
entitypushing {int}: if 1 entity pushing target on collision<br/>
pushingfactor {float}: pushing factor on collision. Default: 1.0<br/>

openborscript functions:
get_entity_collision_collection(void handle, int frame);<br/>
get_entity_collision_instance(void handle, int index);<br/>
get_entity_collision_property(void handle, int property);<br/>
set_entity_collision_property(void handle, int property, value);<br/>

openborscript:<br/>
added "entitypushing", "pushingfactor" to entityproperty<br/>
added "collidedentity" to entityproperty<br/>
added "maxcollisions" to openborvariants<br/>

events:<br/>
onentitycollisionscript<br/>
localvars:<br/>
"self": entity<br/>
"target": entity<br/>
"self_ebox_handler": the handler for ebox of self to use with openborscript functions<br/>
"target_ebox_handler": the handler for ebox of target to use with openborscript functions<br/>


#### ***MULTPLE COLLISION BOXES***
opened multiple collision boxes to openbor:<br/>
you establish the max collision boxes into model.txt file with<br/>
maxcollisions {int} (default: 2)<br/>
then you can change into animation the index of boxes:<br/>
setaboxindex {int} for attack collision boxes (default: 0)<br/>
setbboxindex {int} for body collision boxes (default: 0)<br/>
seteboxindex {int} for entity collision boxes (default: 0)<br/>

by default the index relative to a box is set to 0 of course.<br/>

example:<br/>
```
ANIM IDLE
bbox 1 2 3 4 5
setbboxindex 1
bbox 5 6 7 8 9
```

in this example you set 2 bboxes.

see this example too:

```
ANIM IDLE
bbox 1 2 3 4 5
setbboxindex 1
bbox 5 6 7 8 9
bbox 1 2 3 4 5
```

in this example you set 2 bboxes both: bbox 1 2 3 4 5<br/>
because bbox 1 2 3 4 5 at index 1 overrides bbox 5 6 7 8 9 at index 1<br/>

#### ***BOOMERANG***

model keys:<br/>
subtype boomerang<br/>
aimove boomerang<br/>

model commands:<br/>
boomerang {name}<br/>
boomerangvalues {acceleration} {horizontal_distance}<br/>

animation commands:<br/>
custboomerang {name}<br/>

animations:<br/>
getboomerang<br/>
getboomeranginair<br/>
_use range {min} {max} to get the boomerang by range_

openbor script:<br/>
changed access to boomerang props in openbor script:<br/>
get/change entityproperty "boomerang" "acceleration" {val}<br/>
get/change entityproperty "boomerang" "hdistance" {val}<br/>

using subentity and spawnframe example:<br/>
for player set type npc, for enemies set type enemy<br/>
```
subentity boomerang
spawnframe 0 5 0 30
```

using custboomerang example:
```
custboomerang boomerang
throwframe 0 30
```
#### ***IMPROVED MENUS***

all ports menu now support image previews<br/>
but into PSP/Wii port is disabled by default for less memory usage<br/>

all menus support more mods loading<br/>
implemented vertical scrollbar for menus<br/>
implemented fast forward/backward to scroll menu with many mods (left/right arrow)<br/>
implemented hold key impulse for all menus to scroll menu with many mods more easily<br/>

#### ***NEW PORTS***
PS3 port

#### ***ANDROID PORT***
Display resizeing support
Virtual gamepad vibration
Hiding virtual gamepad support
Improved gamepad support

#### 3RD PART FRONT-END SUPPORT FOR WINDOWS
Command line example:
```
